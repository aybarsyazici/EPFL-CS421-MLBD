    "During the last lectures and lab session, you have dealt into one notable application of machine learning in education, namely knowledge tracing. Machine-learning models optimized for this task aim to understand how well a student is learning a portfolio of skills. Monitoring this knowledge by means of automated models allows to personalize online learning platforms, focusing the assessment on skills the student is weak in and accelerating learning of certain skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to work on the ASSISTment data set presented last week and to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare three knowledge tracing models (BKT, AFM, PFA) in terms of AUC and RMSE.\n",
    "- Generate and discuss the learning curves for a BKT model on a specific set of skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use [pyBKT](https://github.com/CAHLR/pyBKT) and [pyAFM](https://github.com/cmaclell/pyAFM/) throughout this tutorial.\n"

This function should create an iterator object able to split student's interactions included in `data` in `10 folds` such that the same student does not appear in multiple folds. To do so, you can appropriately initialize a scikit-learn's GroupKFold iterator with non-overlapping groups and returning the iterator, i.e., `model_selection.GroupKFold(...).split(...)`. \n",

The data samples associated with a group should not appear in multiple folds or, in other words, the data samples associated with a group should appear all in the same fold. Please, find below a way to use the scikit-learn's GroupKFold object to create folds that meet this property (here, we simulate this scenario by considering only a 2-fold creation strategy):\n",

    "In this section, you should fit a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model on the three skills included in the `data` data set, and compute the corresponding predictions. Then, for each skill included in the data dataframe, you should visually report and discuss (i) the learning curve and (ii) the bar plot representing the number of students who reached a given number of opportunities for that skill, obtained through the BKT model fitted on that skill, in such a way that models' learning patterns can be easily and appropriately compared. No comparison with other baseline model is required.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, we ask you to fit a BKT model with all default parameters, i.e., `Model(seed=0)` in pyBKT, on the full `data` data set (no split into train and test set needed as we are not assessing predictive performance of the model here). Once your BKT model is fitted, we ask you to appropriately create a dataframe named `predictions` with four columns `user_id`, `skill_name`, `y_true`, `y_pred_bkt`. This dataframe should include one row per interaction in `data`, where user_id is the id of the student associated with that interaction, skill_name is the name of the skill involved in that interaction, y_true is the true student's performance on that interaction (1 if correct at the first attempt, 0 otherwise), and y_pred_bkt is the prediction made by the pre-trained BKT model for that interaction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please, note that this task may require a long running time (e.g., about 10 to 20 minutes), depending on your implementation and device. Just as an indication, on a Dell XPS 13, the fit process lasts around 7 minutes.  "
